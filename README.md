# Abstract
1.	Climate is a fundamental driver of macroecological patterns in functional trait variation. However, many of the traits that have outsize effects on thermal performance are complex, multi-dimensional, and challenging to quantify at scale.
2.	To overcome this challenge, we leveraged techniques in deep learning and computer vision to quantify hair coverage and lightness of bees, using images of a diverse and widely distributed sample of museum specimens. 
3.	We demonstrate that climate shapes variation in these traits at a global scale, with bee lightness increasing with maximum environmental temperatures (Thermal Melanism Hypothesis) and decreasing with annual precipitation (Glogerâ€™s Rule). 
4.	Deserts were hotspots for bees covered in light-colored hairs, adaptations that may mitigate heat stress and represent convergent evolution with other desert organisms. 
5.	These results support major ecogeographical rules in functional trait variation and emphasize the role of climate in shaping bee phenotypic diversity.

# Repository Directory
### Code: Contains code for data analysis in R
pilosity_CV_analysis_May2024.R

## Data: Contains the raw specimen and trait data
pilosity_data_jan8.csv: In this document, we present the raw specimen and trait data used in the analysis (pilosity_CV_analysis_May2024.R).

pilosity__data_trait_format_jan8.csv: In this document, we present the same raw data as above, but in a standardized format that lends itself to functional trait data sharing (see this [functional trait data sharing repository](https://github.com/mostwald/Functional-trait-review) for descriptors of column headers). (in progress)

specimen_list_image_figure.csv: In this document, we present specimen data for images displayed in figure X. Specimens are ordered (position column) following the image grid, reading from left to right and top to bottom.
